## How to publish this package to npm
The mdct-core npm package uses semantic-release to publish packages to the enterprise-cmcs npm org. To read more about semantic release please visit the following link: https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release

The publish workflow will run only when pull requests are merged into the **main branch** and the mechanism for publishing relies on the commit message to trigger a publishing build based on a few key words. 

**the 3 keywords for semantic release are as following:**

* **"fix:"**: this will up the patch version of the release number (note: semantic release calls patch a fix release)

* **"feat:"**: this will update the minor version of the release number (note: semantic release calls this a feature release)

* **"perf:"**: this will update the major version of the release number (note: semantic release calls this a breaking release)

**For example: **

**fix: my commit message of choice**

**note:** the commit message needs to be on the merge commit when merging into main and the keyword must not have any spaces between the colon. see screenshot for example
